Place Live2D model files here for the live2d-widget to load.

Expected structure (example):
- public/assets/live2d/model.json
- public/assets/live2d/model.moc3
- public/assets/live2d/texture_00.png
- ...

If you don't provide a model, the widget initialization will silently fail and log a message in the browser console.
